CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:9 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindPistache.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Pistache",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Pistache"
  (requested version 0.0.2) with any of the following names:

    PistacheConfig.cmake
    pistache-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Pistache" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Pistache_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "Pistache" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
